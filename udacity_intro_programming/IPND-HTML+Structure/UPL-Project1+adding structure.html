          <div class="me">
            Hey, I am Murat (44) from Germany and i am a plastics engineer and plastics processing technician.</br>
            Me and <b>my Boy</b> watched <b>TRON</b> last year. He asked me: <b>Daddy, can i program a grid?</b> <b>Of course, i replied and we installed XCode!!!</b> To be a role model for my boys, especially in lifelong learning, i enrolled in Udacity finally down here in China on a business trip.

              <p><b>Texteditor: "The most basic tool"</b></p>
                The contrast between a word processor and text editor is:<br>
                <em>"Word processors allow to create documents for natural language.<br>
                Text editors allow to create instructions in computer language."</em>

              <p><b>Rendering our very first web page</b></p>
                We wrote our first web page. One plain but meaningful sentence rendered in our browser.<br>
                ... why <b>wouldn't I</b> learn to code?

              <p><b>"Now i know, what i don't know."</b></p>
                Although i already knew what i don't know, this explanation is very scientific,<br>
                It creates conciousness and adds a clear horizon to our path.<br>
                <em>"Coding a computer means telling a computer what to do in a way it can understand."</em>

              <p><b>Nanodegre is a path ....</b></p>
                to new knowledge, new skills and new ways of thinking of problems!<br>
                It may benefit me in other real life problems that are not even related to computing.<br>
                <em><b>"And most importantly we'll be able to choose the right direction to continue learning CS or not".</b></em><br>
                This video helped me to understand <span><a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/b920608d-be3c-4d5f-851f-6ab3eeb8997b/modules/eaf0e993-ea8a-47d6-948c-b23d89c55f6e/lessons/edc4d49c-a504-40ee-a6c8-c4f60084ecbf/concepts/35030495730923"></span>
                 "Thinking like a programmer":</a>

              <p><b>Learning mindset means...</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <em>... networking with others,</em><br>
                  <em>... help where you can and ask for help when youÂ´re stuck,</em><br>
                  <em>... use ressources and start to figure out independently first,</em><br>
                  and PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!

          <h3>HTML Basics</h3>
            <div class="h3htmlbasics">
              <p><b>Elements of the web</b></p>
                The web consists of <b>users</b>, <b>computers</b>, <b>servers</b>, <b>HTTP</b>, and the <b>internet</b><br>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>HTTP</b><em>(hypertext tranfer protocoll)</em> the main protocol of the web</li>
                  <li><b>Servers</b> are the computers hosting the files that make up the web</li>
                  <li><b>Internet</b> is the largest computer network</li>
                  <li><b>Browser</b> is a program on the computer which displays files found on the web by interpreting their code</li>
                </ul>

               <p><b>HTML tags</b> are used to create <b>HTML documents</b></p>
               <b>Basic HTML elemts</b> consist of an opening tag and closing tag and the content in between both.<br>
               Void tags are an exception, they do not have a closing tag. We learned about inline (&lt;br&gt;, &lt;span&gt;,...) <br>
               and block tags (&lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, ...) too and their contrast.<br>

               <p><b>HTML-Attributes:</b></p>
                We use them for links and to point at images,like <em>&lt;img src="" alt=""&gt;</em><br>
                but they can surely do more.

            <p><b>Struggling: Atom HTML preview is causing atom to crash on my macOS Sierra 10.12.6</b></p>
            I used the Live Help in Udacity, a very nice guy. He recommened me to reinstall. I replied: I did <br>
            twice already! Then i asked if it's enough to just dump the "atom.app" into the trash. He simply <br>
            wrote, "you have to do more than that" and provided me with the link below. I could feel him smiling.<br>
            He knew obviously that i'd be surprised about what i didn't know.<br>
            Finally i deleted all the installation, tried twice again and then decided to skip Atom's HTML preview.<br>
            <br>
            Here is the <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/how-to-completely-uninstall-atom-for-mac/9084/13">link</a> to the corresponding atom.io discussion forum.<br>
            After dumping the atom.app, i had to delete all these files as shown below.

            <ul>
              <li>~/.atom</li>
              <li>/usr/local/bin/atom</li>
              <li>/usr/local/bin/apm </li>
              <li>/Applications/Atom.app</li>
              <li>~/Library/Preferences/com.github.atom.plist</li>
              <li>~/Library/Application Support/com.github.atom.ShipIt</li>
              <li>~/Library/Application Support/Atom</li>
              <li>~/Library/Saved Application State/com.github.atom.savedState </li>
              <li>~/Library/Caches/com.github.atom</li>
              <li>~/Library/Caches/Atom </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Lessons learned:</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Size matters when you insert images!</li>
              <li>How to look up new Elements like &lt;hr&gt;, &lt;h1-h6&gt; on MDN!</li>
              <li>Using autofill in atom avoids bugs!</li>
              <li>Using shortcuts to search for a specific path on my macOS</li>
              <li>I will never again forget a closing tag or its backslash :)</li>
            </ol>
