CSS:
Selector, declaration, property, value

Style Rules:
CSS type selectors match elemnts by Node name.
e.g. element { style properties }

CSS class selectors based on the contents of the elemnt's class attribute
e.g. .classname { style properties }

CSS ID selectors match an element based on the contents of that element's attribute

Universal selectors (*) matches a single element of any type. Omitting the asterisk with simple selectors has the same effect. For instance, *.warning and .warning are considered equal.
