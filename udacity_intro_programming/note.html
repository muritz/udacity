<h2>Texteditor: "The most basic tool"</h2><br>
The contrast between a word processor and text editor is:<br>
<em>Word processors allow to create documents for natural language.<br>
Text editors allow to create instructions in computer language.

<h2>rendering our very first web page</h2>
We wrote our first web page. One plain but meaningful sentence rendered in our browser.<br>
... why <b>wouldn't I</br> learn dto code
<h3>Something Important:</h3><br>
We reached the second stage in the expertise spectrum:<br>
<b>"Now i know, what i don't know."</b>
Although i already knew what i don't know, this explanation is very scientific,
creates conciousness sketches out a horizon for the path to go.

"Coding a computer means telling a computer what to do in a way it can understand."

Nanodegre a path to new knowledge, new skills and new ways of thinking of problems
which may benefit me in other real life problems not even related to computing.

Learning mindset and networking is important

the web consists of users, computers, servers, http, and the Internet
HTML tags are used to createl HTML documents

<b>HTTP</b><em>(hypertext tranfer protocoll)</em> the main protocol of the web<br>
<b>Servers</b> are the computers hosting the files that make up the web<br>
<b>Internet</b> is the largest computer network
<b>Browser</b> is a program on the computer which displays files found on the web by interpreting their code

Basic HTML elemts consist of opening tag closing tag and the content in between both.
Void tags are an exception. They do not have content and a closing tag




atom-html-preview gave me a hard time with crashing each time i used atom-html-preview
I had to ask my first question to a coach.

I learned how to deinstall Atom correctly and thereby understood that
the standard method on a mac to simply dump the app into trash may
not be sufficient to clean out the system from any other installation an a Mac.
