00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,435
If this is your first Nanodegree program, you start here.

2
00:00:03,435 --> 00:00:06,450
If you've taken a Nanodegree program with us before,

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,775
you already know a little bit of what to expect.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,435
Udacity is always improving our learning experience for students.

5
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:16,289
So you can watch this to see what has changed or you can skip ahead.

00:00:19,995 --> 00:00:22,380
Let's get started. We truly believe that

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:24,750
you couldn't have chosen a better place to learn.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,030
A lot of people have worked tirelessly to create

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,240
the course material and platform features,

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,875
as we all want you to get the most of your learning journey.

12
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,679
Our pledge is to provide you with resources and

13
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,564
services that will further enable you to succeed in your Nanodegree program.

14
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:40,119
As you go through the lessons,

15
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:43,089
you may find some to be difficult and may feel discouraged.

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,010
If this happens, we encourage you to take advantage of

17
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,714
your community channels and mentor services to help clarify the concepts,

18
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:51,065
or just to share your doubts.

19
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:53,149
Our mentors are there to help you.

20
00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:55,399
You will get advice and guidance to ensure

21
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,739
that you are on track to complete the projects.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,700
We want you to succeed and graduate with the Udacity Nanodegree certificate.

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,585
We value the trust you have put in us by making this investment in your future career.

24
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:08,089
We take it very seriously and we're here to help

25
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,460
